NAME
----
faf-bugzilla - Connect to the Red Hat Bugzilla and perform bug,
comment, attachment, and user queries.

SYNOPSIS
--------
'faf-bugzilla' [options]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Opens connection to the Red Hat Bugzilla, receives user queries for
Bugzilla on standard input, and provides the information received from
Bugzilla on standard output.

OPTIONS
-------
--user::
	Bugzilla user (login) name.

--password::
	Password for the user.

--url::
	URL to a Red Hat Bugzilla instance. The default value is
	https://bugzilla.redhat.com/.

Commands that can be sent to standard input
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

'bug' <id> [--raw] [--with-comments] [--with-attachments]::
    Fetches a bug from Bugzilla and displays it on the standard
    output. If --with-comments is present, it also fetches the bug's
    comments and display them on the standard output after the
    bug. The same for --with-attachments. Using --with-comments and
    --with-attachments is several times more effective than calling
    the 'bug' command and then the 'comment' command for every comment
    id from that bug and the 'attachment' command for every attachment
    id. The --raw option is for debugging purposes, it includes
    unformatted response from the server in the standard output.

'comment' <id> [--raw]::
    Fetches a bug comment from Bugzilla.

'user' <id> [--raw]::
     Fetches a Bugzilla user from Bugzilla.

'attachment' <id> [--raw]::
     Fetches an attachment from Bugzilla.

'search-bugs' [--raw] [--whiteboard VALUE] [--whiteboard-type TYPE] [--order ORDER] [--chfield-from DATE] [--chfield-to DATE] [--chfield FIELD]::
     Fetches a list of bugs matching specific criteria.
+
The --whiteboard VALUE option narrows the search to include only
entries which contain VALUE in the whiteboard.
+
The --whiteboard-type TYPE option selects how the --whiteboard's VALUE
is used for a search. Possible values of TYPE are "allwordssubstr",
"anywordsubstr", "nowordssubstr", "equals", "notequals",
"casesubstring", "substring", "notsubstring", "regexp", "notregexp",
"lessthan", "greaterthan", "anyexact", "anywords", "allwords",
"nowords".
+
The --order ORDER option makes the output sorted by certain
key. Possible values of ORDER are "Bug Number", "Importance",
"Assignee", "Last Changed", and a list of database column names
separated by comma. The "Bug Number" order sorts by bug_id. The
"Importance" order sorts by priority and severity. The "Assignee"
order sorts by assigned_to, bug status, priority, and bug_id. The
"Last Changed" order sorts by the last changed date, bug status,
priority, assigned_to, and bug_id. The default order is bug status,
priority, assigned_to, and bug_id. The database column names are, for
example, bug_id, bug_status, priority.
+
The --chfield-from DATE option limits the search to include only bugs
that were changed since the DATE, or to include only bugs, which field
was changed since the DATE (if --chfield is also specified). DATE can
be a date in YYYY-MM-DD format, or it can be a relative value such as
1d (meaning 1 day ago), 2w (meaning 2 weeks ago), 3m (meaning 3 months
ago), or 4y (meaning 4 years ago). 0d means last midnight, 0w means
the beginning of this week, 0m means the beginning of this month, 0y
means the beginning of this year.
+
The --chfield-to DATE option limits the search to include only bugs
that were changed till the DATE, or to include only bugs, which field
was changed till the DATE (if --chfield is also specified). DATE can
be a date in YYYY-MM-DD format, or a special value "Now", or it can be
a relative value like for --chfield-from. Use --chfield-to together with
--chfield-from.
+
The --chfield FIELD option limits the --chfield-form option to limit
changes to a single field. If --chfield is not present and
--chfield-from is, all fields of bugs are considered. The field is a
database column name such as bug_id, bug_status, priority. Also a
special value "[Bug creation]" can be used to check only for new bugs.

'bug-fields'::
     Fetches a list of bug fields.
