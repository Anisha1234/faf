faf-abrt-check-reports(1)
===========================

NAME
----
faf-abrt-check-reports - Check ABRT-reported bugs from Red Hat
Bugzilla to find various issues with ABRT.

SYNOPSIS
--------
'faf-abrt-check-reports' [options]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This tool performs various checks on ABRT-reported bugs from Red Hat
Bugzilla to find various issues. It checks bugs and their attachments
and comments.

The tool goes through all rhbz-bug entries in the local cache, and
detects ABRT-reported bugs. For such a bug it checks if a backtrace is
attached. If the backtrace is a C/C++ one produced by GDB, it runs
btparser on it.

Via btparser the tool checks the backtrace quality rating, duplicate
hash, crash function etc. If the output from btparser does not match
the bug entry, it is reported.

It also checks the backtrace rating stored in the first comment, and
duplication hash nad crash function.

All the check results are stored in the abrt-report-checks target. The
check (cache entry) id is the id of the checked rhbz-bug.

If the tool finds a rhbz-bug for which some comment or attachment is
missing in the local cache, it skips the check for that bug. It is up
to the caller to make sure that the local cache is in coherent
state. The faf-cache-closure-rhbz(1) tool can be used to do that.

OPTIONS
